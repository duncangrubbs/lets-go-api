# Let's Go API

### An API for the **Let's Go** app.

### What is Let's Go?
Let's go is a web application for finding new friends.

### How to Use
After cloning the repository, do the following.
- Run `yarn` to install all dependencies
- Run `yarn start` to start the dev server
- Run `mongod` in a seperate terminal window and
then `yarn test` to test

### This app is build with:
1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - package manager
3. [Babel](https://babeljs.io) - for JS transpiling ES6
4. [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com) - for MongoDB
5. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - JSON database
6. [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) - Javascript test assertion library
7. [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) - For simulating HTTP requests when testing

I am using mongoDBCompass and Postman as resources for testing the API routes
and the database.
